# GPT

GPT is an alternative of ChatGPT. Using this we can perform all the functionalities of ChatGPT like text-to-text answering, test-to-image generation and Retrieval-Augmented Generation implimentation.

I have used LLMs like Ollama and Stable Diffusion for implimentation of this.

<h1>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mode</h1>
